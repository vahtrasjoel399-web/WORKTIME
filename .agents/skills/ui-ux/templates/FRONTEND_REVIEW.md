## Project cognition

- [ ] Page matches the project's human definition
- [ ] User and primary task are clear from the layout
- [ ] Business objects are not incorrectly mixed
- [ ] Page type matches layout and style choice

---

## UX flow

- [ ] Entry point and page orientation are clear
- [ ] First decision and primary action are obvious
- [ ] Information appears in task order, not data-model order
- [ ] Browse / inspect / edit / commit responsibilities are separated
- [ ] User receives clear success / completion feedback after action
- [ ] Error, empty, permission denied, and destructive-action states provide recovery
- [ ] Mobile layout reorders around the primary task instead of only stacking

---

## Human-language copy

- [ ] UI does not paste README or architecture copy
- [ ] UI does not narrate agent reasoning, implementation contracts, or panel purpose as primary copy
- [ ] Review treats examples as context/hierarchy failures, not a string blacklist
- [ ] Technical states are translated to user language
- [ ] Error copy includes reason, impact, and next step
- [ ] Raw IDs / JSON are secondary or hidden unless developer-focused
- [ ] Primary UI language is consistent; protocol/API terms are secondary unless required

---

## Visual and product fit

- [ ] Product temperament is appropriate for this surface
- [ ] Style supports the task rather than decorating it
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear
- [ ] Creative choices preserve baseline craft instead of hiding weak alignment or hierarchy
- [ ] UI is not merely a default component-library template
- [ ] Page has product identity without fake-premium decoration

---

## Baseline craft

- [ ] Alignment, spacing, and panel rhythm are coherent across the whole page
- [ ] Empty space is intentional; no leftover unfinished regions
- [ ] Primary, secondary, and utility actions are visually distinct
- [ ] Actions are close to the content they operate on
- [ ] Read-only status does not look like editable input
- [ ] Navigation controls and display-only status indicators are visually distinct
- [ ] Human labels are primary and technical identifiers are secondary
- [ ] Numeric precision, tag semantics, separators, selected states, and overflow rules are consistent

---

## Interaction and states

- [ ] Loading state
- [ ] Empty state
- [ ] Error state
- [ ] Permission denied state with access/request path
- [ ] Success / completion feedback with next step
- [ ] Long-text handling
- [ ] Dangerous action protection (confirmation / undo)
- [ ] Responsive / mobile task layout

---

## Component and system quality

- [ ] Existing components reused where appropriate
- [ ] New components justified (existing components insufficient because…)
- [ ] Table / form / detail responsibilities separated
- [ ] Repeated patterns identified for codification

---

## Findings

| P2 | [Should fix] | | |
| P3 | [Nice to have] | | |
