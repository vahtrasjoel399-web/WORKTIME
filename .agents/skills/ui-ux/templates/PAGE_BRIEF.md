## Page name

[Name]

## Surface type

[marketing / docs / API console / admin / ops workbench / CRUD list / object detail / setup wizard / mobile task / other]

## User

[Who uses this page and what context they arrive in]

## Primary task

[The single most important thing the user wants to accomplish on this page]

## Entry and journey

- **Entry point / previous step:** [Where the user comes from and what they already know]
- **First decision:** [The first meaningful choice the page asks from the user]
- **Success criterion:** [What proves the task is complete]
- **Next step after success:** [Where the user should continue]

## Secondary tasks

- [Task]
- [Task]

---

## Information priority

What should be most visible, in order:

1. [Most important — conclusion, state, or action]
2. [Second]
3. [Third]

## What must NOT appear on this page

- [Background information that would clutter the task]
- [Internal terms that should be translated or hidden]
- [Data that belongs in a detail surface, not here]

---

## Layout decision

[Why this page uses table / workbench / detail panel / wizard / cards / split pane / etc. Link to the user task.]

## Baseline craft decision

- **Grid / alignment:** [How major regions align and where the page should end]
- **Spacing rhythm:** [Main gap and padding choices]
- **Action hierarchy:** [Primary / secondary / utility actions for this page]
- **Action proximity:** [Where actions live relative to target content]
- **Status vs controls:** [How read-only state differs from inputs / tabs / buttons]
- **Technical identifiers:** [Where endpoints, IDs, URLs, JSON, or filenames appear and how they are visually secondary]
- **Empty-space policy:** [What empty space means, or what should collapse]

## UX risks and recovery

| Risk / state | User impact | Recovery / next step |
|---|---|---|
| [Error / empty / permission / destructive action / long task] | [Impact] | [Retry / undo / request access / change input / details] |

## Mobile priority

[What appears first on narrow screens, what is collapsed, and where the primary action lives]

---

## Components

| Component | Purpose | Existing or new |
|---|---|---|
| [Component] | [What it does here] | [existing: path/to/component | new: justify] |

---

## Required states

- [ ] Loading
- [ ] Empty
- [ ] Error (with reason, impact, and next step)
- [ ] Permission denied
- [ ] Long text / overflow

## Copy notes

User-facing words to use:

- [word]

Primary language for labels, states, and actions:

- [language / locale]

Internal terms to translate:

| Internal term | User-facing label |
|---|---|
| [term] | [translation] |

Agent-only context not to show as primary UI copy:

- [implementation detail / design intent / protocol explanation]

Context rule:

- This is not a banned-phrase list. Keep technical language when it helps the page's user act, debug, or recover; otherwise move it to tooltip, diagnostic detail, docs, or code comments.

## Anti-pattern risks

- [Most likely failure mode for this specific page]
- [Journey / friction / recovery risk]

## Verification

- [ ] Desktop screenshot
